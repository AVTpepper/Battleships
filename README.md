# __Portfolio Project 3 - Battleships__
At the start of the project I was looking forward to not having to worry too much about the style and what the finished end product would look like. I didnt know I could be that wrong. I enjoyed spending quite a bit of time putting in finishing touches trying to make the game look better, but also give a better experience to the user. I am happy with the end product and I hope plenty of people can have fun playing it!

##__Planning Phase__##
I always had a clear picture in my head of how I wanted to the game look like. I did create a flowchart on paint, which was lost into the unsaved files folder... AKA not to be found ever again. This is something I can learn from, making sure to make a proper plan, since as I move along with a project I should always be able to look back at what my idea was to get myself back on track. A flowchart will also help with keeping the logic simple without overcomplicating steps throughout the creation.
