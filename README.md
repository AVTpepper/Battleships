# __Portfolio Project 3 - Battleships__
At the start of the project I was looking forward to not having to worry too much about the style and what the finished end product would look like. I didnt know I could be that wrong. I enjoyed spending quite a bit of time putting in finishing touches trying to make the game look better, but also give a better experience to the user. I am happy with the end product and I hope plenty of people can have fun playing it!

##__Planning Phase__##
I always had a clear picture in my head of how I wanted to the game look like. I did create a flowchart on paint, which was lost into the unsaved files folder... AKA not to be found ever again. This is something I can learn from, making sure to make a proper plan, since as I move along with a project I should always be able to look back at what my idea was to get myself back on track. A flowchart will also help with keeping the logic simple without overcomplicating steps throughout the creation.

    - First we have the welcome message where the program gives the user an idea of how the game works. 
    - User will also be asked to enter their board size.

- __Creation of the board__
    - Once the grid size is chosen the program will run and create the given board size.
    - There will be a short dialogue underneath the board to give a sense of immersiveness.

- __Missing a ship__
    - Most of the time you will be missing the ships.... If you do miss a ship there will be added an "X" to the position that the user guessed.

- __Game Over__
    - If you are unlucky like me, then you will probably miss all the ships. Once you run out of shots you will get this message:

- __Hitting A Ship__
    - Dont worry, there are ships on the board. If you hit a ship this is what it will look like.
    - An "O" will mark the spot on the board.

- __Victory Screen__
    - I made a smaller board for myself so it would be easier to get a winning screen. Here is what that would look like:
