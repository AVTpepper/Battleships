"""
This file includes the battleship code.
Information for the player:
- Can has a maximum size of 10 rows and 10 columns.
- The board will always have the same amount of rows and columns.
- The size you chose will multiply by itself.
    - Example: a board size 3 would be 3 rows and 3 columns.
- Columns are represented by letters.
- Rows are represented by numbers.
- You will always guess row first, then followed by columns.
- The ships will be hidden on the board.
- If you hit a ship it will be marked with an "O".
- If you miss a ship it will be marked with an "X"
